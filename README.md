# A Study of Security Threats in Android Applications from the Health and Fitness category
With the ever-increasing use of smartphone technology, the use of mobile applications has gained many attractions in the field of healthcare and fitness in improving personal wellness. However, since these applications are also generating and storing sensitive data of the users every minute, the privacy and security challenges have also increased. This project explores the security threats in the top 500 Health and Fitness applications from Google Play Store based on the OWASP Top Ten Mobile Security Risks and tries to find a correlation between the security of an app with their popularity and usage. The project expects to find how the security risks change, or if they change at all when the ranking of the apps are considered. The initial hypothesis was that highly used mobile apps would have less severe vulnerabilities since they tend to update and fix bugs more frequently. However, this paper concludes that the hypothesis is partially correct even though no concrete statement could be made according to the results. Ultimately, this paper tries to infer in what ways the security threats differ in Android applications and how important the role of design and implementation of an application plays in its privacy and security risks.
